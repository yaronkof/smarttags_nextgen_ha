# SmartThings Find NextGen
This is a spiritual successor to https://github.com/Vedeneb/HA-SmartThings-Find as I really wanted that feature.

Viewing smart tags locations on Home Assistant

This project currently only allows to see the locations of the smart tags and not control them in any way. I don't currently plan to try and add these things.

I only have 1 smart tag so I haven't tested it with more than 1, it should work as I dynamically get the list but it might be broken on certain conditions. If you find bugs, feel free to open an issue.

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

Since this integration is not currently in the default HACS store, you can easily add it as a Custom Repository:

1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant dashboard.
2. Click the **three dots** in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Paste the URL of this GitHub repository into the **Repository** box.
4. For **Category**, select **Integration**.
5. Click **Add**.
6. Find the **SmartThings Find NextGen** integration in the list and click **Download**.
7. Restart Home Assistant.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use HACS, you can install the integration files directly onto your server:

1. Download the latest release source code (or clone this repository).
2. Using an SSH client, Samba, or the File Editor add-on, locate your Home Assistant `config/` directory.
3. Look for a folder named `custom_components`. If it does not exist, create it.
4. Copy the `smarttags_nextgen_ha` folder from this repository into your `custom_components/` directory.

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to the Integrations page.
2. Search "SmartThings Find NextGen".
3. Visit https://smartthingsfind.samsung.com/ and log in with your Samsung account.
4. Open Developer Tools in your browser.
5. Copy the JSESSIONID value. Note to copy the one from smartthingsfind.samsung.com (you might have another from another domain).
6. Enter your JSESSIONID into Home Assistant.
7. Enjoy :)
